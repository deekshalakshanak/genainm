These models learn patterns from training data and then generate new, similar content based on input prompts.  Recent advancements in transformer-based deep neural networks, especially large language models (LLMs), have driven a surge in GenAI systems. Examples include chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, image generators like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, and video generators like Sora.\n",
